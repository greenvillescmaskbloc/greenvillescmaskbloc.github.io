In the spirit of respect, reciprocity, and truth, we acknowledge that Greenville Mask Bloc is an organization based in serving the traditional land of the [ᏣᎳᎫᏪᏘᏱ Tsalaguwetiyi (Cherokee, East)](https://ebci.com/), [S’atsoyaha (Yuchi)](https://www.srbeucheetribe.org/), [Mánu: Yį Įsuwą (Catawba)](https://catawbaindian.net/), and [Miccosukee](https://www.instagram.com/miccosukeetribeofindians/) Peoples. We honor the sovereignty of these and all Indigenous nations including their lands and waters.

Both the State of South Carolina and the United States Government carried out genocide, ethnic cleansing, and forced removal against these Peoples as a way to acquire land. The United States and State Governments broke treaties. Despite centuries of colonial theft and violence, this is still Indigenous land. Colonialism is not yet a relic of the past. These Peoples are still here and continue to fight against the ongoing genocide that seeks to erase their existance.

Land acknowledgments are only one small part of supporting Indigenous communities. We hope our land acknowledgment statement will inspire others to stand with us in solidarity with Indigenous nations by:
* Honoring the sovereignty of all Indigenous nations
* Supporting Indigenous organizations by donating your time and/or money
* Supporting Indigenous-led grassroots change movements and campaigns
* Commit to honoring treaties and returning land
